You panic until you feel a slightly painful burning in your chest, and you realize the ring has split in two and embedded itself in your nipples. Graz'zt has claimed you in your sleep, and you are His.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each transformed ring bears a sinister black sheen, its surface eerily smooth against your skin. Spiked adornments, reminiscent of thorns on a rose stem, trace along its length, hinting at a painful removal. His claim is not easily relinquished. </content>

Usually, the pleasure builds to a peak then ebbs, but the wave you're currently riding on seems to continue to build. Your hands follow that feeling, almost of their own accord, but stop a few inches short: there's a heat, a throbbing warmth that wasn't there before. You glance down and your breath catches. A mark, a brand- His brand! now claims your pubic mound, glowing with a pink light that pulses in time with your breath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As your hands begin downward once more and your eyes close, the last thing you see before succumbing to pleasure is the brand's glow, beating in time with your ragged, hungry breaths.</content>

Fortunately for you, or unfortunately, Graz'zt seems to already have his eyes set on another in your party. He spares you only a glance, and the rest of your dream is a sweet and incoherent mess.
