## Scripted Effects
If you have Loviatar's Love (status boost that lasts until you die), taking a long rest with the boots on will progressively advance `Remodelled Frame` permanent boost, up to 4 times, with effects listed below. The theme is muscle loss, tendon shortening, and so on (no model change yet).
To avoid body modification, die to remove Loviatar's Love.
```
-1 STR
-1 STR -1 DEX +1 CHA
-2 STR -1 DEX +1 CHA
-2 STR +2 CHA
```

Additionally, with stacks of `Remodelled Frame`, removing the boots will give debuff until you re-equip the boots, the severity of which stacks with the `Remodelled Frame` stacks.
With each stack, you receive `-1m movement speed, -1 DEX`.
