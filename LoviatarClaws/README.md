## Features
- tintable
- thematic passive and active abilities
- optional body modification content

## Ability Explanations
Pain Mirror: AOE reflect 1d6+CHA psychic damage whenever you receive damage above 0. Enemies can avoid this damage by passing a WIS save (against a DC that should scale with your CHA).
Inviting Dance: concentration AOE taunting aura for 2 turns that gives disadvantage on attacks on people other than you, encouraging the AI to target you more.

## How to Get
- (recommended) get Loviatar's Love from getting hit sufficiently well by Abdirak (Loviatar priest in the goblin camp)
- tutorial chest that you can also get via [summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457)
- `07ea67e5-344b-4de6-91d3-449cce27a685` spawn with script

## Body Modification (requires bg3se)
If you have Loviatar's Love (status boost that lasts until you die), taking a long rest with the boots on will progressively advance `Remodelled Frame` permanent boost, up to 4 times, with effects listed below. The theme is muscle loss, tendon shortening, and so on (no model change yet).
To avoid body modification, die to remove Loviatar's Love.
```
Inception: -1 STR +1 CHA
Foundation: -1 STR -1 DEX +2 CHA
Maturation: -2 STR -1 DEX +3 CHA disadvantage on intimidation checks
Perfection: -2 STR +4 CHA advantage on Persuasion checks, disadvantage on intimidation checks
```

Additionally, with stacks of `Remodelled Frame`, removing the boots will give a debuff until you re-equip the boots, the severity of which stacks with the `Remodelled Frame` stacks.
With each stack, you receive `-1m movement speed, -1 DEX`. At 4 stacks, you also receive disadvantage on DEX saving throws. This is due to your feet having been remodelled to need the heel support to walk, as otherwise you're either crawling on your knees or walking on tip-toes.

## Installation
- unzip and copy the `.pak` file to `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods` as per usual
- activate via the [bg3 mod manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases) as per usual
- install [BG3SE (script extender)](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases)

## Known Issues
Pain mirror currently reflects in a ball around the attacke rather than your character. This is fine vs melee attackers, but weird vs ranged attackers.
