## Game Mechanics
- at the end of every turn, CON saving throw to avoid overstimulation
    - failure resets stimulation counter and puts you incapacitated for one turn and feeds the armor (sated boost until long rest)
    - success increases DC of next check (start at DC 4, increase by 3 per turn)
        - at DC > 10 receive penalties to AC and so on
- persistent buffs
    - base 12 AC (clothing)
    - +1 to spell attack rolls and spell save DC
    - resistance to acid damage
    - disadvantage on concentration checks
    - stage 0
        - add CHA modifier to cantrips (see Potent Robe)
        - add CHA to AC (vs melee only)
    - stage 1
        - add CHA modifier to cantrips
        - add CHA to AC (vs melee only)
        - +1 crit threshold
    - stage 2
        - add CHA modifier to damage rolls (including spells)
        - add CHA to AC (vs melee only)
        - +1 crit threshold
        - -1 damage from all sources (see Reaper's Embrace)
    - stage 3
        - add CHA modifier to damage rolls (including spells)
        - add CHA to AC (vs melee only)
        - +1 crit threshold
        - -2 damage from all sources
    - stage 4
        - add CHA modifier to damage rolls (including spells)
        - add CHA to AC
        - +1 crit threshold
        - -2 damage from all sources
        - (TODO/scrapped for being too OP) spell once per combat: AOE psychic pull (like Myrkul's pull ability)
- stimulation each turn in combat
    - after each turn, make CON saving throw that gets progressively harder each time you succeed, reset upon failing
    - after failing, gain 1 sated stack, become incapacitated for one turn
- sated buffs from being overstimulated (can be stacked 3 times, you can 1 stack after failing CON save)
    - 2HP regeneration per round per stack
    - removes disadvantage on concentration checks
    - +1 saving throw per stack
- to progress to the next form, need to have the required remodelled body stage, and long rest with at least 3 stacks of sated
        
## Structure
- one visual model per remodelled frame stage (4 stages)
    - different models for F and FS body types

- transfering body modifications to non-human bodies (tiefling and githyanki)
    - join the different bodies from each stage as shape keys to a basis one
    - mesh data transfer shape keys to non-human base body
    - duplicate the non-human base body, set one of the shape keys to 1, apply all shape keys to get an equivalent body of that stage
